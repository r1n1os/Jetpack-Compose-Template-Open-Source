# Jetpack-Compose-Template-Open-Source

Jetpack-Compose-Template-Open-Source is a production-ready Jetpack Compose Android project template following **Google's best practices** and implementing **Clean Architecture** out of the box. It was developed to save time and help developers kick-start new Android projects with the right structure and dependencies already in place. Just clone, rename, and build!
